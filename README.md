# TheGoodsLife

This is a project done for Paris’ [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com) 2012.

Keep in mind that this was rushed over a night, so the code isn’t really good…

## AngelHack submissions

### APIs Used

MapBox, Google Maps (geocoder), Facebook OpenGraph.

### Technologies Used

Ruby On Rails, PostgreSQL, CoffeeScript, HAML, SCSS, Compass. Deployed on
Heroku.

### Tagline

_Give your goods a second life. Or a third._

### We Built…

We built TheGoodsLife, a platform where you can give away what you don’t need
anymore or request something you need now.

With this project, we decided to focus on people and objects by revealing the
hidden story behind everyday goods. Objects will have their own story and you
will be encouraged to put them back in the loop after use.
